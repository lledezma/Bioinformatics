# Bioinformatics
## The Folders contain the following:
- A program to analyze protein sequences using the following pattern-match algorithms: Boyer-Moore, KMP, and Suffix-Arrays.
- A program to fetch a PDB file from online and analyze it in different ways (Sheets, helices, Atoms, torsion angles, distances, and more).
 
## Final Bioinformatics Project. 
### It downloads over 30k PBD files to parse them and to analyze the data. Parallel programming features are used to speed up the process.
- It creates json files from the data of interest and it creates visual representations out of those json files.
- The program finds the distribution of phi and psi angles for amino acids in helices and beta sheets. It uses a Ramachandran plot for visual representation of the distribution.
- Finds torsion angles.
- Analyzes lengths of helices.
- Finds the rise distance between any two consecutive Ca atoms in helices.
- Finds the rise distance between any two consecutive Ca atoms in sheets.
